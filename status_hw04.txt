Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Kate Rupar


2. What hostname did you deploy your app to?
hw04.astrometer.art


3. What's the URL of your git for this assignment?
https://github.com/rupark/cs4550-hw04.git

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
The calculator function works, but can only add. I could not figure out how to switch the mode. I also was unable to get factoring working. I created a recursive function, but the list would not append.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
I'm running into the error "System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate. Failed to connect to bus: Host is down". It doesn't seem that anyone online has a solution for this error on Debian. I am able to deploy by running the deploy script manually, but I cannot start the systemd service.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
Not very comfortable.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Learning Elixir, creating a systemd service
